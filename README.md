> Conducted in 2013 by Chris Whong, the NYC Taxis: A Day in the Life website follows random yellow-cab taxi drivers during a 24-hour period. Utilizing data from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Whong creates a visualization of the route patterns and pay of New York City taxi drivers. Some potential applications from this dataset include the analysis of New York traffic patterns, carpooling habits, and active timeframes for taxi usage. This analysis can help assess better traffic solutions, such as providing more taxi drivers during high usage times or creating incentives for carpooling.

### Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World
by David Easley and Jon Kleinberg

> Published by the Cambridge University Press in 2010, Cornell University professors David Easley and Jon Kleinberg highlight the expansive connectedness of our world in their book "Networks, Crowds, and Markets".  The book seems to take a holistic approach to our physical and virtual worlds by exploring human psychology and sociology through computational data analysis. I found this book particularly interesting due to the ever-growing datafication of our world. From traffic patterns to the effects of advertisements, I believe this book sheds light on the habits and trends of people through computational research. This form of study is vital to understanding how populations interact with the world around them.
